## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React Native)
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements + Custom components
- **Charts**: Victory Native for data visualization
- **Authentication**: Expo SecureStore for token storage
- **Biometrics**: Expo LocalAuthentication

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **API**: RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- **Security**: Helmet.js, rate limiting, input validation
- **File Storage**: Local storage or AWS S3 for documents

### Data Aggregation
- **Option 1**: Plaid API for bank connections (recommended)
- **Option 2**: Yodlee API (enterprise solution)
- **Option 3**: Open Banking APIs (for specific regions)
- **Fallback**: Manual transaction entry

### Security & Compliance
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **PCI Compliance**: Follow PCI DSS guidelines
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: SMS/Email verification

## Database Schema (Core Tables)

### Users
- id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
- profile info, preferences, security settings

### Accounts
- id, user_id, account_type, institution_name, account_name
- balance, currency, is_active, last_synced

### Transactions
- id, account_id, amount, description, date, category_id
- is_pending, merchant_name, location, notes

### Categories
- id, name, parent_category_id, color, icon
- is_system_category, user_id (for custom categories)

### Budgets
- id, user_id, category_id, amount, period_type
- start_date, end_date, is_active

### Budget_Periods
- id, budget_id, period_start, period_end
- budgeted_amount, spent_amount, remaining_amount

## App Architecture Patterns

### State Management
- Redux store with slices for: auth, accounts, transactions, budgets, ui
- RTK Query for API calls and caching
- Persistent state for offline functionality

├── Transactions
├── Budgets
├── Accounts
└── Profile

Stack Navigators for each tab
Modal overlays for forms and details
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing
- Use secure communication protocols
- Implement proper session management
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Financial Data Handling
- Never store bank credentials
- Use tokenized account access
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow financial industry security standards

### User Privacy
- Minimal data collection
- Clear privacy policy
- User data export/deletion capabilities
- Opt-in analytics and tracking

## Monetization Strategy (Future)

### Subscription Tiers
- **Free**: Basic budgeting, limited accounts
- **Premium**: Unlimited accounts, advanced analytics, goal tracking
- **Pro**: Investment tracking, tax optimization, financial advisor access

### Additional Revenue
- Affiliate partnerships with financial institutions
- Premium financial content and courses
- Financial product recommendations (ethical approach)
