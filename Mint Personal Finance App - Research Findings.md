## Detailed Founding Story (from TIME interview):

### Aaron Patzer's Background:
- Age 25 when he started Mint in 2006
- Described himself as "an inventor first and foremost. An engineer. An entrepreneur. In that order"
- Had previous jobs at IBM and a startup
- Was working 80-hour weeks, which led to the problem of not being able to manage his personal finances
- Had $100,000 in savings when he quit his day job to focus on Mint full-time

### The Idea and Early Development:
- **Core Vision**: "To make money management effortless and automated"
- Started working on the idea nights and weekends while employed
- Decided to quit his job because he couldn't live with going "halfway, part-time"
- Worked alone for the first 6 months: "14 hours a day, six days a week for six months straight before I got funding from an angel investor"
- Built most of Mint.com's prototype by himself

### Technical Challenges:
- Hadn't done web development in 8 years when he started
- Knew nothing about Java web services at the time
- Had little knowledge about databases
- Was "really good at one thing: algorithms"

### Personal Challenges:
- Described the emotional toll: "I oscillated day-to-day between feeling like I had the greatest idea ever and feeling like it would never work"
- Questioned his worth: "wondering who I was to take on Intuit and Microsoft"
- Was an introvert, new to Silicon Valley, didn't know other engineers
- Had to overcome shyness to network and find help

### Early Hiring and Funding:
- Hired his first engineer "in the top of a tree on an organized hike"
- First round of funding was closed "out of the trunk of my car at one of the dozens of events I attended â€” after being shot down at least 50 times"
- Sought out top talents in security, design, and communications to complement his algorithm skills

**Technical Legacy:**
Mint pioneered the use of automated financial data aggregation for consumer applications, initially leveraging Yodlee's technology before Intuit developed its own system. The application used a sophisticated architecture with SQL databases, queue-based processing, MapReduce for data analysis, and robust security measures.

The service grew to over 20 million users before being shut down in March 2024, marking the end of one of the most successful fintech applications of the 2000s and 2010s.
