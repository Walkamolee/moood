## Understanding Money Mood

### The Five Money Moods

Money Mood uses five distinct facial expressions to represent your financial health. Each mood is calculated based on your budget performance and spending patterns.

#### 😊 **Excellent Mood** (0-49% of budget spent)
- **What it means**: You're crushing your budget goals!
- **App icon**: Bright green background with joyful upward smile
- **Message**: "Great job! You're staying well within your budget."
- **Psychology**: Positive reinforcement encourages continued good habits

**When you'll see this:**
- Early in the month when you've just started spending
- After receiving income or bonuses
- When you've been particularly mindful of spending

#### 🙂 **Good Mood** (50-74% of budget spent)
- **What it means**: You're doing well and staying on track
- **App icon**: Mint green background with gentle content smile
- **Message**: "You're on track! Keep up the good spending habits."
- **Psychology**: Encouragement to maintain current behavior

**When you'll see this:**
- Mid-month when you're spending normally
- After making planned purchases within budget
- When your spending is predictable and controlled

#### 😐 **Warning Mood** (75-99% of budget spent)
- **What it means**: Getting close to your limit - be mindful!
- **App icon**: Yellow background with straight horizontal mouth
- **Message**: "Approaching your budget limit. Consider your next purchases carefully."
- **Psychology**: Gentle warning without causing stress

**When you'll see this:**

- When you need to be more selective about spending

#### ☹️ **Danger Mood** (100-109% of budget spent)

- **Message**: "Seriously over budget! Review your spending and make adjustments."
- **Psychology**: Strong motivation to correct behavior

**When you'll see this:**
- When spending is significantly above budget
- After major unexpected expenses
- When immediate action is needed to get back on track

### How Moods Are Calculated

#### Budget-Based Calculation
```
Mood = (Total Spent ÷ Total Budget) × 100

Examples:
- Spent $800 of $2000 budget = 40% = 😊 Excellent
- Spent $1500 of $2000 budget = 75% = 😐 Warning  
- Spent $2200 of $2000 budget = 110% = 😱 Over Budget
```

#### Category-Specific Moods
Each budget category has its own mood:
- **Groceries**: $400 spent of $500 budget = 80% = 😐 Warning
- **Entertainment**: $150 spent of $200 budget = 75% = 😐 Warning
- **Transportation**: $100 spent of $300 budget = 33% = 😊 Excellent

#### Overall Mood Calculation
Your overall mood is calculated using a weighted average:
- **High-priority categories** (groceries, housing) have more influence
- **Discretionary categories** (entertainment) have less influence
- **Recent spending** is weighted more heavily than older transactions

### Mood Triggers and Notifications

#### Real-Time Updates
- **Instant Mood Changes**: Your mood updates immediately when transactions sync
- **Push Notifications**: Get notified when your mood changes significantly
- **Widget Updates**: Your home screen widget reflects current mood

#### Smart Notifications
- **Spending Alerts**: "You're approaching your dining budget limit"
- **Mood Changes**: "Your money mood just changed to Warning 😐"
- **Weekly Summaries**: "This week your mood averaged Good 🙂"
