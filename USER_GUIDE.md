## Understanding Money Mood

### The Five Money Moods

#### üòä **Excellent Mood** (0-49% of budget spent)
- **What it means**: You're crushing your budget goals!
- **App icon**: Bright green background with joyful upward smile

### How Moods Are Calculated

#### Budget-Based Calculation
```
Mood = (Total Spent √∑ Total Budget) √ó 100

Examples:
- Spent $800 of $2000 budget = 40% = üòä Excellent
- Spent $1500 of $2000 budget = 75% = üòê Warning  
- Spent $2200 of $2000 budget = 110% = üò± Over Budget
```

#### Category-Specific Moods
Each budget category has its own mood:
- **Groceries**: $400 spent of $500 budget = 80% = üòê Warning
- **Entertainment**: $150 spent of $200 budget = 75% = üòê Warning
- **Transportation**: $100 spent of $300 budget = 33% = üòä Excellent

#### Overall Mood Calculation
Your overall mood is calculated using a weighted average:
- **High-priority categories** (groceries, housing) have more influence
- **Discretionary categories** (entertainment) have less influence
- **Recent spending** is weighted more heavily than older transactions

### Mood Triggers and Notifications

#### Real-Time Updates
- **Instant Mood Changes**: Your mood updates immediately when transactions sync
- **Push Notifications**: Get notified when your mood changes significantly
- **Widget Updates**: Your home screen widget reflects current mood

#### Smart Notifications
- **Spending Alerts**: "You're approaching your dining budget limit"
- **Mood Changes**: "Your money mood just changed to Warning üòê"
- **Weekly Summaries**: "This week your mood averaged Good üôÇ"
