# Security and Compliance Requirements for Financial Applications

## PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) Requirements

### Overview
PCI DSS is a mandatory security standard for all organizations that process, store, or transmit credit card data. The standard includes 12 core requirements and over 300 sub-requirements designed to protect cardholder data.

### The 12 Core PCI DSS Requirements

1. **Install and maintain a firewall configuration** to protect cardholder data
2. **Do not use vendor-supplied defaults** for system passwords and other security parameters
3. **Protect stored cardholder data** through encryption and secure storage
4. **Encrypt transmission of cardholder data** across open, public networks
5. **Protect all systems against malware** and regularly update anti-virus software
6. **Develop and maintain secure systems and applications**
7. **Restrict access to cardholder data** by business need to know
8. **Identify and authenticate access** to system components
9. **Restrict physical access** to cardholder data
10. **Track and monitor all access** to network resources and cardholder data
11. **Regularly test security systems and processes**
12. **Maintain a policy** that addresses information security for all personnel

### Mobile Application Specific Requirements

2. **Right to delete**: Request deletion of personal information
3. **Right to opt-out**: Opt out of sale of personal information
4. **Right to non-discrimination**: Equal service regardless of privacy choices

### Business Obligations
- **Privacy notices**: Clear disclosure of data collection practices
- **Verification procedures**: Verify consumer identity for requests
- **Response timeframes**: Respond to requests within 45 days
- **Record keeping**: Maintain records of consumer requests and responses

## Financial Industry Specific Regulations

### Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
- **Privacy notices**: Annual privacy notices to customers
- **Opt-out rights**: Allow customers to opt out of information sharing
- **Safeguards rule**: Implement comprehensive security program
- **Pretexting provisions**: Protect against fraudulent access to financial information

### Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Rules
- **Personal Financial Data Rights**: New rules for data sharing and access
- **Open banking requirements**: Standards for third-party data access
- **Consumer consent**: Explicit consent for data sharing with third parties
- **Data portability**: Enable consumers to move their financial data

## International Compliance Considerations

### Regional Requirements

### Cross-Border Data Transfers
- **Adequacy decisions**: Transfer data to countries with adequate protection
- **Standard contractual clauses**: Use approved contract terms for transfers
- **Binding corporate rules**: Internal rules for multinational organizations
- **Certification mechanisms**: Use approved certification schemes

## Security Implementation Requirements

### Encryption Standards
- **Data at rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **Data in transit**: TLS 1.3 for network communications
- **Key management**: Hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage
- **Perfect forward secrecy**: Ensure past communications remain secure

### Authentication and Access Control
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Require MFA for all administrative access
- **Role-based access control**: Limit access based on job functions
- **Privileged access management**: Special controls for administrative accounts
