# Why Intuit Shut Down Mint: Research Findings

## Official Announcement and Timeline
- **Announcement**: November 2023
- **Initial Shutdown Date**: January 1, 2024 (later extended)
- **Final Shutdown Date**: March 23, 2024
- **User Base**: Estimated 3.6 million active users as of 2021

## Official Reason from Intuit
- Intuit says it's "reimagining" the app as part of Intuit Credit Karma
- Users are being migrated to Credit Karma (acquired by Intuit in 2020)
- Credit Karma is known more for credit monitoring services

## Key Issues and User Concerns
- **Feature Gap**: Credit Karma does not currently provide budgeting features the same way that Mint has in the past
- **Limited Migration**: Only basic features available in Credit Karma:
  - Monthly spending broken down by category
  - Average spending for each category
  - How much monthly spending differs from the previous month

## User Reactions
- Users expressed disappointment and surprise
- Many users noted the app had been "abandoned for years" with minimal software updates
- No consensus on a free alternative that offers all the same budgeting features
- Quote from user: "This is the peril of relying on free services"

## Data Migration
- Users can transfer linked financial accounts to Credit Karma
- Can bring majority of Mint financial account balances, historical net worth and three years of transactions
- Users who don't join Credit Karma can request a copy of their data or request deletion


## Detailed Business Analysis (LogRocket)

### Official Reason
- Consolidation of Intuit's personal finance products
- Prioritize focus on Credit Karma, which has "more features and functions than Mint"
- However, key Mint features like budgeting are not available in Credit Karma

### Financial Reasons - "Keeping Mint made no financial sense"
1. **Technical Debt**: App developed for 16 years hit a breaking point where previous shortcuts required significant technical investment
2. **Weak Monetization Model**: Mint relied on advertisements and referrals, which may not have been sufficient
3. **Cost vs. Revenue**: If the cost of keeping the product going was close to the money it brought in, it made sense to shut it down
4. **P&L Analysis**: Converting even a few percent of Mint users to other Intuit products could be more profitable than maintaining Mint

### Strategic Acquisition Theory - "It was the plan all along"
- Intuit may have acquired Mint in 2009 to eliminate a potential competitor
- Similar to how established companies buy emerging competitors before they become threats
- 14 years is sufficient time to execute such a plan without obvious aggressive takeover optics
- Bonus: Acquired talent at a discount

### User Acquisition Strategy - "It was always about the users"
- Acquiring new users is expensive (Customer Acquisition Cost - CAC)
- Purchasing a product with millions of users can be cheaper than traditional marketing
- Mint acquisition may have cost $2-3 per lead, comparable to successful Facebook campaigns
- The "lead wagon" may have slowed down in recent years, making it less attractive

### Strategic Misalignment - "It no longer made strategic sense"
- Running similar products with competing teams may no longer make sense
- Better to focus all company potential on a single product with better revenue potential
- Mint may not have supported Intuit's overall business growth goals


## Critical Monetization Issues (Sacra Research)

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) Problems
- **Mint's ARPU**: Only $2-$3 per user
- **Comparison**: This is extremely low compared to successful subscription products:
  - Duolingo: $484M trailing twelve months revenue in Q3'23
  - Spotify: $14.3B revenue in 2023
- **Business Model Issue**: "They had the wrong business model" - giving the product away for free and monetizing off referrals

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Crisis
- **Industry CAC**: Rose to $600-$1,000 range due to VC-backed apps giving "insane sign-up bonuses"
- **Impact**: Drove personal finance startups away from paid ads towards content marketing
- **Sustainability**: High CAC made paid acquisition unsustainable for most players

### Market Saturation
- Personal finance space became saturated with VC-backed competitors
- Competition drove up acquisition costs significantly
- Made Mint's low-revenue model even less viable

### Expert Analysis from Former Mint Product Manager
- Val Agostino (ex-Mint product manager, now CEO of Monarch Money) confirmed the business model was fundamentally flawed
- Mint lacked the revenue scale befitting the clear category leader in personal finance
- Free model with referral monetization couldn't support the infrastructure and development costs


## Performance Metrics and Competitive Analysis (Appfigures)

### Download Performance
- **Mint Downloads (Jan-Oct 2023)**: 1.9M downloads
- **Rocket Money Downloads (same period)**: 4.6M downloads (2.4x more than Mint)
- **October 2023**: Gap widened to 3.6x in favor of Rocket Money
- **Decline**: Mint's monthly downloads dropped 42% since January 2020
- **Competition Growth**: Rocket Money's downloads rose 41% in the same period

### Revenue Performance
- **Mint Revenue (2023)**: $1.6M net revenue
- **Revenue per User**: $0.86 per user (net, after Apple/Google fees)
- **Platform Split**: 96% from App Store, 3.8% from Google Play
- **Rocket Money Revenue**: $8.7M (5.4x more than Mint)
- **Rocket Money per User**: $1.40 per user

### Market Position
- Mint was NOT the most downloaded budgeting app despite Intuit's size
- Lost both the downloads race and monetization race to competitors
- Some positive: Mint's monthly mobile revenue grew 26% since beginning of 2023
- However, this growth was insufficient to justify continued investment

### Historical Context
- Mint was revolutionary when acquired in 2009 - automated transaction pulling and classification
- Intuit took 14 years to finally shut it down
- Features were gradually integrated into other Intuit products (TurboTax, Quicken)


## Summary: Why Intuit Shut Down Mint

### The Perfect Storm of Factors

Intuit's decision to shut down Mint in March 2024 was the result of multiple converging factors that made the app unsustainable:

### 1. **Fundamental Business Model Failure**
- **Unsustainable ARPU**: At only $2-$3 per user, Mint's revenue was far too low to support a major app
- **Wrong Monetization Strategy**: Free app with referral-based revenue couldn't compete with subscription models
- **Comparison**: Successful apps like Duolingo and Spotify generate hundreds of millions to billions in revenue

### 2. **Competitive Market Dynamics**
- **Lost Market Leadership**: Despite being a pioneer, Mint was no longer the most downloaded budgeting app
- **Outperformed by Competitors**: Rocket Money had 2.4x more downloads and 5.4x more revenue
- **Rising CAC**: Customer acquisition costs rose to $600-$1,000, making paid acquisition unsustainable

### 3. **Technical and Operational Challenges**
- **16-Year Technical Debt**: Legacy codebase required significant investment to modernize
- **Security and Integration Costs**: Maintaining bank connections and security standards was expensive
- **Minimal Updates**: Users noted the app had been "abandoned for years" with few meaningful updates

### 4. **Strategic Business Decisions**
- **Portfolio Consolidation**: Intuit wanted to focus resources on Credit Karma, which had "more features and functions"
- **Resource Allocation**: Running competing products with separate teams no longer made strategic sense
- **User Migration Strategy**: Moving users to Credit Karma was more profitable than maintaining Mint

### 5. **Market Saturation and Economics**
- **VC-Backed Competition**: Saturated market with competitors offering "insane sign-up bonuses"
- **Unsustainable Unit Economics**: High CAC combined with low ARPU made growth unprofitable
- **Better Alternatives**: Intuit's other products offered better revenue potential

### The Final Verdict

Mint's shutdown was ultimately a business decision driven by economics. Despite having 25 million registered accounts and being a beloved product, Mint could not generate sufficient revenue to justify continued investment. The combination of low monetization, high competition, technical debt, and strategic misalignment made it a logical candidate for discontinuation.

As one former Mint product manager put it: "They had the wrong business model." Fourteen years after acquisition, Intuit finally acted on what the numbers had been showing for years - Mint was a user acquisition tool that had outlived its usefulness in a portfolio focused on higher-revenue products.

### User Impact
- 3.6 million active users forced to migrate
- Limited feature parity in Credit Karma (no budgeting features)
- Mass migration to competitors like YNAB, Monarch Money, and others
- Loss of 16 years of financial data and habits for many users
